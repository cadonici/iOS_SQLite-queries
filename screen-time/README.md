# iOS Screen Time Analysis SQLite Queries

This repository contains SQLite queries for the iOS RMAdminStore-Local.sqlite database, providing insights into application screen time and user interactions. The queries are organized based on time values, calculated in both Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and Local Time.

## Usage

- **UTC Queries:** Explore application screen time data with timestamps in Coordinated Universal Time.
- **Local Time Queries:** Analyze the same data with timestamps converted to the local time zone.

## Database Overview

The RMAdminStore-Local.sqlite database contains valuable information for monitoring application screen time and user interactions on iOS devices. The data is organized into "blocks," each lasting 60 minutes. This organization facilitates a granular understanding of app usage patterns over time.

## Example Values

- **Screen Time in Seconds:** Retrieve total screen time for individual apps or entire blocks.
- **Number of Pickups:** Analyze the frequency of device pickups and their correlation with application usage.
- **Notification Count:** Explore the number of notifications received during specific time periods.
