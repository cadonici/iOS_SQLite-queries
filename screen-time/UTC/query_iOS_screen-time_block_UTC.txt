/*
    iOS Screen Time Block Analysis Query (UTC)
    -------------------------------------------------

   This SQL query is designed to be executed on the iOS RMAdminStore-Local.sqlite database,
    providing valuable insights into the screen time usage patterns for each app.

    The query retrieves detailed information for each time block, focusing on local time.
    It includes data such as screen time, number of notifications, number of pickups,
    block duration, and timestamps for the start, end, first pickup, last event,
    longest session start, and the longest session ends in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format.
